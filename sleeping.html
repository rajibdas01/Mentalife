      <h2>Top Sleeping Tips</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule:</strong> Set a regular time for going to bed and waking up, even on weekends. This stabilizes your internal clock and enhances natural sleep patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:</strong> Spend 30–60 minutes unwinding before bed. Activities like reading, meditating, or taking a warm bath can help.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Exposure to Screens:</strong> Blue light from screens disrupts melatonin production. Turn off devices an hour before bed or use filters/glasses.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch Your Diet:</strong> Avoid caffeine, heavy meals, or spicy food close to bedtime. Opt for light snacks like bananas or almonds if you're hungry.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Moderate activity earlier in the day promotes better sleep. Avoid intense workouts close to bedtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a Comfortable Environment:</strong> Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Use blackout curtains, earplugs, or white noise machines as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Daytime Naps:</strong> Restrict naps to 20–30 minutes and avoid napping late in the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Practice mindfulness, deep breathing, or journaling to keep anxiety at bay.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrate Wisely:</strong> Drink less water before bed to minimize nighttime disruptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider Sleep Aids (If Necessary):</strong> Consult a professional for natural supplements like melatonin if needed.</li>
